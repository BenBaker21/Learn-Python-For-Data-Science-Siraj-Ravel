Learn Python For Data Science, Siraj Ravel Videos

##General overview:
This repository was made to store the projects from Siraj Ravel's youtube series "Learn Python for Data Science"

##Gender Classification (demo.py)
Used the decision tree classification algorithm provided by sklearn to predict gender based on height, weight, and shoe size. The challenge for this project was to expand on it and compare performace with other sklearn classification models. The decision tree is compared with the models K-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, stochastic gradient descent, perceptron, support vector classification, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and random forest classifaication. The best one is then tested with a sample height, weight, and shoe size, and prints out the prediction.

##Twitter Sentiment Analysis (PublicSentimentFun.py)
Program uses the tweepy library to access Twitter's API, and the TextBlob library to perform sentiment analysis for each tweet and find it's polarity and subjectivity. This can be used to see if a tweet is negative or not. The project challenge was save each tweet to a csv file with an associated label of "good" or "bad". I further built on this by enabling multiple items to be entered at command line, and the program will print out and save to a csv the average polarities, subjectivities, and good/bad label for each item.
